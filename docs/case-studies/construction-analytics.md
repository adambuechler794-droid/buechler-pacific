# Multi-Island Construction Project Analytics

**Status:** On website
**Category:** Data Intelligence

---

## Summary

Integrated NetSuite financials with HCSS project budgets into real-time Power BI dashboards. The company president used the dashboard once and scheduled training for all project managers himself. PMs now use it daily to track project health and catch issues before they compound.

**Website result line:** President became internal champion — PMs use it daily

## Challenge

Construction company managing 10+ concurrent projects across Hawaiian islands had no systematic way to track project-level profitability or identify cost overruns until month-end close.

- Financial data lived in NetSuite
- Project budgets and job costing were in HCSS (construction PM software)
- No integration between systems
- No IT department to build data infrastructure
- Ad-hoc analysis took hours to days depending on complexity
- PMs had zero visibility into project financials

---

## Solution

Built Power BI dashboard integrating NetSuite financials with HCSS project budgets to show:

- Real-time project profitability
- Budget vs. actual variance analysis
- Transaction-level detail (drill from P&L to individual invoices and vendors)
- Early warning system for budget overruns

**Systems:** Power BI, NetSuite, HCSS, DAX, Power Query

---

## Results

- Leadership and PMs gained visibility into project health that simply didn't exist before
- Early warning system for budget overruns enables intervention before problems compound
- PM team can now self-service their own analysis instead of waiting for finance
- PMs use the dashboard daily

## The Greg Story (Key Moment)

When the President finally used the PM Job Dashboard, he was given transaction-level insight into jobs he had never had before — on demand. He said Adam "should have been busting down his door the day the PBI project was finished."

He immediately started vetting costs and holding people accountable. He loved the dashboard so much that he scheduled a meeting so Adam could walk the PMs through how to use it. **PMs now use it daily.**

**Why this matters:** The president became Adam's internal champion, scheduled training himself, and drove daily adoption. This is pull-through demand from leadership — the opposite of the typical BI project that dies on the vine.

## PM Testimonial

> "It does a great job of keeping things on track. I am sure it will catch something major one of these days."
> — Project Manager

**Context:** The PMs can't remember a specific crisis *because there haven't been any.* The dashboard works as preventive infrastructure — PMs catch issues early before they escalate. Greg gives you the dramatic impact moment. PMs give you durability.

**Action item:** Get PM permission to use quote attributed to "Project Manager, Hawaii Construction Company" on the website.

## Positioning Value

- **Adoption proof** — the strongest proof that "built for adoption" isn't just marketing copy
- **Leadership buy-in story** — president became champion without being asked
- **Shows the full arc** — disconnected systems → integrated reporting → daily decision-making
- **Relatable to any project-based business** — not just construction

---

## Gaps to Fill

- [ ] Specific dollar value of cost overruns caught (may not exist — and that's the point: preventive infrastructure)
- [ ] How many projects are being tracked simultaneously?
- [ ] PM permission for testimonial use
