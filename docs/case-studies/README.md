## The Anchor Narrative

All Alpha Inc. case studies are chapters within a single transformation arc:

> "I took a construction company from emailed spreadsheets and CSV pulls to a modern data platform where leadership sees project health in real-time, PMs forecast their own expenses, and the finance team got 5+ days back every month."

See [positioning.md](../positioning.md) for the full brand narrative.
