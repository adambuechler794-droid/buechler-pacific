# Positioning & Brand Strategy

## Core Identity

**Buechler Pacific** is an AI and data engineering consultancy that builds financial intelligence systems for mid-market companies. Based in Maui, Hawaii.

**Tagline:** AI Systems for Finance.

**One-liner:** We engineer AI-powered systems that turn your data into decisions — from infrastructure to intelligence.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: Mid-Market CFOs and CEOs

Companies with $20M–$500M revenue that are:

- Still closing books on the 15th–20th of the month
- Drowning in emailed spreadsheets and manual reconciliation
- Running finance on disconnected systems (ERP + Excel + email)
- Can't see project or business health until it's too late
- No IT department or dedicated data team to build infrastructure

### Industry Focus

- **Construction** (project-based businesses with multi-site operations)
- **Professional services** and project-based companies
- **Consumer goods** companies scaling beyond spreadsheet-based FP&A

### Buyer Profile

Decision-makers who:
- Have felt the pain of "Excel hell" and know they need to modernize
- Don't want a 6-month consulting engagement that produces a slide deck
- Value systems that their team will actually adopt and use daily
- Want a partner who understands finance, not just technology

## Value Propositions

### 1. Finance + AI Engineering in One Person

Most consultants are either finance people who can't build, or engineers who don't understand the business. Adam sits at the intersection — FP&A background combined with hands-on AI development, data engineering, and full-stack product builds.

### 2. Built for Adoption, Not Just Delivery

The Greg Story is the proof: the company president used a dashboard once and scheduled training for all project managers himself. PMs now use it daily. The differentiator isn't building a dashboard — it's building one that people actually use.

### 3. The Excel Bridge (Not Rip-and-Replace)

Most consultants either tell clients to abandon Excel (which never works) or leave them in Excel hell. Buechler Pacific offers the actual bridge — users keep working in Excel while data flows to modern infrastructure underneath. Familiar tools, structured data.

### 4. Infrastructure That Compounds

Every data model built makes the next analysis faster. Every source connected creates new possible analyses. The ROI isn't a one-time project — it's an accelerating capability. The VS Code moment: work that would take days in Excel, a morning in Power Query, done in 15 minutes — but only because months of prior data infrastructure made it possible.

### 5. AI That's Actually Useful

Not AI for the sake of AI. Custom GPTs that let executives query financial data in plain English. Automation that turns a three-person, full-day process into a one-person, one-hour process. The human stays in the loop — "the human double-checking the automation."

## Differentiators vs. Competition

| Typical BI Consultant | Buechler Pacific |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Builds dashboards | Builds infrastructure, dashboards, AI tools, and the adoption strategy |
| "Abandon Excel" or "Stay in Excel" | Excel-to-Fabric bridge — familiar tools, modern infrastructure |
| Delivers a project | Delivers a compounding platform |
| Technology-first | Finance-first — understands the business problem before building |
| 6-month engagement, slide deck | Ship fast, iterate based on reality |

---

## Methodology: The Repeatable Pattern

Every engagement follows the same arc:

**Siloed systems → Integrated reporting → Better decisions**

| Before | Bridge | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| NetSuite + HCSS | Project analytics dashboard | President holds PMs accountable with data |
| NetSuite + Excel | Fabric data warehouse | Ad-hoc queries in minutes instead of days |
| Excel chaos | Excel-to-Fabric sync | Structured data, familiar tools |
| 3 people + CFS assembly | Power Pivot + Fabric | One person, under an hour |
| Monthly PowerPoints | Live PBI dashboard | Days recovered, real-time data |

### Process

1. **Understand** — Map data landscape, identify bottlenecks, define what intelligence the business needs
2. **Build** — Engineer solutions designed for adoption, working with the team, not around them
3. **Transfer** — Build the team's independence; every system comes with knowledge to own it
4. **Iterate** — Ship fast, refine based on reality; no six-month rollouts

## Positioning Statement

For mid-market CFOs and CEOs who are still running finance on disconnected systems and manual processes, Buechler Pacific engineers AI-powered financial intelligence systems — from the data infrastructure to the AI layer that makes it useful. Unlike traditional BI consultants who deliver dashboards that nobody uses, we build for adoption from day one and create compounding platforms that get more valuable over time.

---

## Key Proof Points

- **Monthly close:** 20th → 15th (targeting 12th) — 5+ days recovered
- **Cash flow statement:** 3 people, full day → 1 person, under an hour (90% automated)
- **Ad-hoc analysis:** 10x faster — days to minutes
- **Adoption:** President became internal champion, scheduled PM training himself, PMs use dashboards daily
- **SwellScore:** Full-stack product built and shipped — React + TypeScript + Flask, live in production, real-time multi-source data integration

## Quotes & Moments

> "He should have been busting down my door the day that PBI project was finished."
> — Company President, after using the PM Job Dashboard for the first time

> "It does a great job of keeping things on track. I am sure it will catch something major one of these days."
> — Project Manager (daily dashboard user)

The president became an internal champion without being asked. He scheduled training for all PMs himself. This is pull-through demand from leadership — the opposite of the typical BI project that dies on the vine.

The PM quote is actually the stronger long-term proof: the dashboards work as preventive infrastructure. PMs can't remember a specific crisis *because there haven't been any.* The president gives you impact. The PMs give you durability.
