# Project Expense Forecasting System

**Status:** Not on website (available for future use)
**Category:** FP&A / Data Intelligence

---

## Summary

Aligned JTD (Job-to-Date) costs from NetSuite with budgets from Heavy Job (HCSS) by cost code. Built into a repeatable monthly process — the first PM-driven expense forecasts in company history.

---

## Challenge

PMs had no repeatable process for forecasting project expenses:

- Budget data lived in Heavy Job (HCSS)
- Actual costs lived in NetSuite
- No systematic way to compare budgets to actuals or project forward
- Every comparison required manual CSV pulling and hours of reconciliation

---

## Solution

Aligned JTD costs from NetSuite with budgets from Heavy Job by cost code. Built into a repeatable monthly process that PMs can execute independently.

**Systems:** Power BI, NetSuite, HCSS/Heavy Job, DAX, Fabric

**Technical proof point:** Adam can now line up JTD costs and budgets by cost code in minutes because it's all modeled. Can repeat the same analysis for other jobs in seconds.

## Results

- First PM-driven expense forecasts in company history
- Easily repeatable month over month
- Surfacing WIP cleanup issues that were previously invisible
- New project status categories added to segment risk
- Leadership making better decisions daily from forecast information

---

## Positioning Value

Strong proof of FP&A depth — this is the kind of work that only someone with deep finance knowledge and data engineering skills could build. It bridges the gap between two systems that were never designed to talk to each other.

## Why It's Not on the Website (Currently)

Overlaps with the Construction Analytics case study (same systems, same company, similar outcome). The Greg adoption story is more compelling for the website than the technical forecasting details.

Can be featured if:
- The site adds longer-form case study pages where this becomes a subsection of the Construction Analytics story
- A prospect specifically needs forecasting capability proof

## Gaps to Fill

- [ ] How many PMs are using this?
- [ ] Specific WIP cleanup example
- [ ] Dollar impact of better forecasting visibility
- [ ] What do the new project status categories look like?
