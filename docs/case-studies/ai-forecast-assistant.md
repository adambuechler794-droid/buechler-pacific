## Challenge

The finance team maintained multiple forecast versions and scenarios, but business users struggled to understand variances between versions or extract insights without analyst help. Every question — "Why did Q3 EBITDA forecast change from v2 to v3?" — required an analyst to pull data, build a comparison, and write up an explanation.

## Solution

Built a custom GPT trained on the company's forecast models. The system enables natural language queries about:

- Budget vs. forecast comparisons
- Version-to-version variance analysis
- Variance drivers and explanations
- Scenario comparisons

Business users ask questions in plain English and get context-aware, intelligent financial analysis in seconds — no analyst intermediary required.

**Systems:** Custom GPT, OpenAI API, structured prompt engineering, forecast data integration

## Results

- Reduced analyst time spent answering forecast questions by ~70%
- Business leaders get answers in seconds instead of waiting for analyst availability
- Increased forecast adoption and understanding across the organization
- Hours of manual analysis compressed to conversational queries

## Positioning Value

This is the most directly "AI" case study — a custom LLM tool that transforms how executives interact with financial data. It demonstrates:

- Practical LLM/GPT application (not a demo, a real business tool)
- Understanding of what makes AI useful in finance (natural language interface to structured data)
- The "AI that's actually useful" philosophy — not AI for the sake of AI
