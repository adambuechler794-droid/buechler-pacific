# Monthly Close Acceleration

**Status:** Not on website as standalone (metrics used in Impact section)
**Category:** Cumulative Transformation Narrative

---

## Summary

Not a separate project — the combined result of all infrastructure built at Alpha Inc. Monthly close went from the 20th to the 15th (targeting the 12th), recovering 5–8 days per month. The recovered time shifted from **report assembly to actual analysis.**

## The Transformation Arc

### Before (Aug 2024)
- Monthly close on the **20th**
- No budget existed — had to build one from scratch
- No ERP reporting — data lived in Foundation (legacy system)
- Ad-hoc analysis took **hours to days**
- Data silos: NetSuite, HCSS, Excel, PDFs — no integration
- No IT department
- No single source of truth
- "Excel hell" — emailed spreadsheets, version control chaos

### After (Feb 2026)
- Monthly close on the **15th**, targeting the **12th**
- Ad-hoc analysis **10x faster** — complex queries in minutes
- First real PM-driven expense forecasts in company history
- President using PM Job Dashboard daily
- PMs trained and using dashboards daily
- WIP cleanup issues surfacing that were previously invisible
- Fabric models queryable across systems
- VS Code + Python + Claude workflow: 15 minutes for work that used to take days

## Key Enablers

| Enabler | Time Recovered |
|---------|---------------|
| CFS automation | Full day (3 people → 1 person) |
| Month-End PBI replacing PowerPoint assembly | Days per month |
| Fabric pipelines eliminating manual data gathering | Hours per cycle |
| Automated reporting reducing manual reconciliation | Hours per cycle |
| Self-service dashboards reducing ad-hoc request load | Ongoing |

## The Connecting Thread

This is the meta-narrative that ties everything together:

- Greg can hold PMs accountable because dashboards exist
- CFO and FP&A Director can review WIP before close because CFS wasn't eating their day
- PMs can forecast because models are built
- The infrastructure freed everyone to do work that actually matters

**The close went from report construction to business intelligence.**

## The Compounding Insight

The platform investment pays dividends you don't even plan for:

- Every model built makes the next analysis faster
- Every data source connected creates new possible analyses
- The ROI compounds over time — it's not a one-time project, it's an accelerating capability

## How This Appears on the Website

The monthly close metrics feed the **Impact section** stats:

- **5+ Days** recovered monthly
- **90%** automated (CFS)
- **10x** faster analysis

The transformation arc informs the overall site narrative but doesn't appear as a standalone case study card — it's the story *behind* all the individual case studies.

- [ ] Did they hit the 12th target for January 2026?
- [ ] Other specific processes that accelerated the close?
