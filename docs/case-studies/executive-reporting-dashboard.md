# Executive Month-End Reporting Dashboard

**Status:** Not on website (available for future use)
**Category:** Data Intelligence

---

## Summary

Built a Month-End Power BI dashboard that replaced the monthly PowerPoint package entirely. The CFO presents it directly to executives — live data, no assembly required.

---

## Challenge

Monthly executive reporting required building PowerPoint presentations every month — a process that took days of assembly time. Static slides were stale the moment they were exported, and the cycle repeated every single month.

---

## Solution

Built a Month-End Power BI dashboard that replaced the monthly PowerPoint package entirely. CFO presents it directly to executives with his name on it — no supplementary slides needed.

**Systems:** Power BI, Fabric semantic model

---

## Results

- **Saves days per month, every month** — permanently eliminated a recurring time sink
- CFO trusted it enough to present to executives with his name on it
- Executives now see live/current data instead of static snapshots
- Over a year: estimated 20–30 working days saved on this single deliverable
- Time redirected from report assembly to actual analysis

## Positioning Value

Every finance team in America spends days building monthly PowerPoint decks. Replacing that with a live dashboard that the CFO presents directly is universally relatable and immediately valuable. It's the "stop building reports, start using them" philosophy made concrete.

## Why It's Not on the Website (Currently)

Dropped in favor of the 5 most AI-forward case studies. Strong proof point but positions as "BI consultant" more than "AI engineer." Can be added back if the positioning evolves or if a 6th card is added.

## Gaps to Fill

- [ ] What does the dashboard cover? (P&L, project health, variances, KPIs?)
- [ ] How many executives review it?
- [ ] Has it changed the quality of executive discussions?
